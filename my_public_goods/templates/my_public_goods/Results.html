    You started with an endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }},
    of which you contributed {{ player.contribution }}.
    Your group contributed {{ group.total_contribution }},
    resulting in an individual share of {{ group.individual_share }}.
    Your profit is therefore {{ player.payoff }}.
    {% if Constants.num_rounds == group.round_number %}
